  <h2>What Is an AED?</h2>
  <p>
    An Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is a portable medical device
    that analyzes heart rhythms and delivers a shock if needed to restore
    a normal heartbeat during sudden cardiac arrest.

  <h2>Why Early AED Use Matters</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Survival decreases 7–10% for every minute without defibrillation</li>
    <li>Most cardiac arrests occur outside hospitals</li>
    <li>Early AED access can double or triple survival rates</li>
  </ul>
